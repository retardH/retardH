## Nice to Meet You ;) !
I'm an junior level web developer .  :technologist: 
I'm here to share my projects and learn from seniors.
I can build both static and dynamic web apps.
I stay up-to-date with latest technologies to deliver high quality solutions to any problem.
I'm developing myself everyday by learning new skillsets, building many small projects for practising. 
I'm also learning frameworks and other third-party libraries like redux(state management toolkit) and react-query to work with my projects.
